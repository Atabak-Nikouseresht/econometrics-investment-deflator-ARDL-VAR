# Econometric Analysis of Investment Deflator Inflation (ARDL & Cointegrated VAR)

This project analyzes the long-run and short-run determinants of **investment deflator inflation** using time-series econometric techniques.  
It was completed as part of the Econometrics course at the University of Bologna.

## Objective
To study how **import prices** and **domestic value-added inflation (adjusted for indirect taxes)** affect investment-goods inflation over time.

## Methods Used
- ADF Unit Root Tests  
- HP Filtering (cycle extraction)  
- ARDL Model (Pesaran–Shin–Smith bounds test)  
- Johansen Cointegration  
- VAR & Cointegrated VAR (VECM)  
- Impulse Response Functions (IRFs)  
- RESET, Breusch–Godfrey, White tests

## Key Findings
- Import price inflation and domestic value-added inflation have **significant positive long-run effects** on investment deflator inflation.  
- ARDL and Johansen results confirm a **stable long-run cointegrating relationship**.  
- Short-run effects exist but are weaker and adjust more gradually.
